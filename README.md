# How to configure nodes
Guide on how to configure the minecraft plugin nodes, commonly used in big geopolitical servers like Crusalis. (Map Painting)

# Installation
First, download the [znodes plugin](https://modrinth.com/plugin/znodes)

Download [Dynmap](https://modrinth.com/plugin/dynmap) (Compatible with minecraft version 1.21.3)

# Server
Make a paper server in version 1.21.3

Start the server to get basic configuration files

Paste the znodes and dynmap .jar files into plugins

# Dynmap configuration
In the console, run dynmap fullrender nameofyourworld (dynmap cancelrender nameofyourworld to stop the fullrender)

This will take a while, so be patient.

# Nodes configuration
Nodes is a difficult plugin to deal with, since it's pretty broken, but i'll do my best.

To actually make territory (nodes) you need the nodes editor, which you can find at http://localhost:8123/editor.html or http://localhost:8123/nodes.html (Note: This only works if you are self-hosting, if not, you have to find the numerical address of your server (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX))

Keep in mind that you actually have to make the html file, because the current znodes .jar file doesn't do that automatically, so the file will be here on this repository.

# Installation guide
After you've downloaded the files from the repository, go to your server's folder, plugins, dynmap and then web, paste the contents of the repository there (!MAKE SURE YOUR SERVER IS STOPPED!)
